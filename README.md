# KerubGame

Simple web game built for the presentation of the E-Team Squadra Corse's work in the 2017 season of Formula SAE.
Aim of the game is to present the various parts that make up the single seater, all of which are designed and assembled by the team.

The game was first presented at IPSIA "A. Pacinotti" in Pontendera and later published at kerubgame.eteamsquadracorse.it
